## Functions

- The bus stops in front of obstacles, detected by ultrasonic sensors.
- The doors open simultaneously when the bus stops.
- The doors are closed and the bus starts moving again, when the obstacle is cleared.

## Components

- Arduino Mega 2560
- 1x Ultrasonic Sensor
- 1x Servo Motor
- 1x Big Motor *(dunno what it's called)*
- 2x LED Nodes
- 1x Motor Driver
