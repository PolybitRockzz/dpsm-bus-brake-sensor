An Arduino project where a bus model uses input from ultrasonic sensors to stop in front of obstacles and open the doors simultaneously. Made for a carnival project at Delhi Public School, Megacity.

## Functions

- The bus stops in front of obstacles, detected by ultrasonic sensors.
- The doors open simultaneously when the bus stops.
- The doors are closed and the bus starts moving again, when the obstacle is cleared.

## Components

- Arduino Mega 2560
- 1x Ultrasonic Sensor
- 2x Servo Motors (1 for Door, 1 for Bus Motor)
- 1x Breadboard
